# Exercise - JPA Entity Mappings -1

These exercises will investigate a great deal of the most useful Object-Entity mappings available in JPA. You should however, be aware of that the amount possible annotations are enormous. For this exercise we will create the tables from the Entity classes, so we know exactly what we do. At the end however, you should create a new project and its entity classes from the tables generated by this exercise. This will show you a great deal of those annotations we haven’t used (because we are using default values)

### Getting Started

1. Create a new plain (Maven) java application, and add the packages: entity, test and enums
In the test package, add a class Tester including a main method. Create a test method in this class from which we will do all interactions with the Entity Manager.

2. Create a local MySQL database

3. eee
    1. Create an Entity class, Book with only one field (apart from the id) title. Use GenerationType.IDENTITY to let the     database generate ids automatically (using AUTO_INCREMENT).
  Make sure you understand why you are requested to use GenerationType.IDENTITY and not one of the others.

    2. Include the MySQL JDBC Driver to the project. (if it wasn’t included in step 3a)
  Right Click dependencies → Add Dependency  → Type "mysql-connector-java" in the Query Text Field  → Select the newest version 5.1.39 (will save your for a lot of time-zone related problems) of the Driver.
  Open the pom-file to see how the dependency was added to the file.

    3. in your test method, create an EntityManager (use the slides if you need hints)
  For all of these exercises, you should (initially) select the Drop and Create strategy in your persistence.xml file
