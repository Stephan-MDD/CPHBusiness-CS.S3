# Exercise - JPA Entity Mappings -1

These exercises will investigate a great deal of the most useful Object-Entity mappings available in JPA. You should however, be aware of that the amount possible annotations are enormous. For this exercise we will create the tables from the Entity classes, so we know exactly what we do. At the end however, you should create a new project and its entity classes from the tables generated by this exercise. This will show you a great deal of those annotations we havenâ€™t used (because we are using default values)
