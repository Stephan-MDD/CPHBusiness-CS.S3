# Exercise - JPA Entity Mappings – 2
*These exercises are meant to assist you in learning important ORM-topics. The task is not to complete the exercises as fast as possible, but to LEARN important concepts. Don’t skip parts like :  “Make sure you understand ..”, “explain why ..” etc. These parts match typical questions given at the exam.

### Relationship Mapping
Object oriented programming is, to a large degree, about creating classes which relate to each other. If a class cannot solve a problem by itself, it delegates the job to another class. 
Relations between classes have **cardinality**, and can be either *bi- or uni-directional.*
There are 8 different combinations of Cardinality and Direction, and they can all easily be implemented in JPA with some nice NetBeans-assistance.

| Cardinality  | Direction |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| One-to-one  | Unidirectional  |
| One-to-one  | Bidirectional  |
| One-to-many | Unidirectional |
| Many-to-one one-to-many | Bidirectional |
| Many-to-one | Unidirectional |
| Many-to-one | Unidirectional |
| Many-to-one | Bidirectional |

In the following, we will test four of these combinations 

### Getting Started

For this exercise you need two Entity classes as sketched below:
`Customer`	→ With the fields `id(Integer), firstName(String), lastName(String)`
`Address`	→ With the fields `id (Integer), street (String), city (String)`
For both classes, use `GenerationType.IDENTITY` to let the database generate ids automatically (using MySQLs `AUTO_INCREMENT` feature)
Create a new plain java maven project (or continue with the project from day-1), and use the netbeans-wizard to add the two entity classes + relevant getters, setters and constructors (don't forget the zero-arg constructor. 
Add a Tester-class, similar to day-1, and this line to verify that we can create the matching classes:
`Persistence.generateSchema("NAME_OF YOUR_PU", null);`

*Note: The following exercises is just as much a recap on your second-semester knowledge about relational mappings. DON’t skip the steps, where you are requested to compare Entity Classes to the generated tables. This is to a large degree what what we will discuss at the examination.*
